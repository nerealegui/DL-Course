**MLP**

MLP stands for "Multilayer Perceptron." It is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) that consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, except for the input nodes, is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLPs are widely used for solving problems that require supervised learning.


**Data Augmentation**

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your training data without actually collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of the existing data by applying various transformations such as rotation, translation, scaling, flipping, and adding noise. This helps improve the robustness and generalization ability of machine learning models, especially in tasks like image classification, where having a large and varied dataset is crucial.
